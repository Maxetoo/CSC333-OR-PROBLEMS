Resource Allocation for Two Projects
Objective:
The goal is to allocate resources (labor and capital) between two projects (P1 and P2) to maximize profit.

Approach:

Profit Function:
The total profit is the sum of profits from projects P1 and P2, given by the expression 8P1 + 7P2. This is a maximization problem, so again we negate the profit coefficients to make it suitable for the minimization function of linprog.

Constraints:
The constraints are given by labor and capital requirements for both projects. Each project requires a certain amount of labor and capital, and we have upper limits on these resources. These are again linear inequalities represented by the system Ax â‰¤ b.

Solving the Problem:
Using linprog, we minimize the negative of the profit function while adhering to the resource constraints. This will give us the optimal allocation of resources to maximize profit.

Result and Interpretation:
The result gives us the optimal number of projects P1 and P2 to undertake, maximizing the company's total profit under the resource limitations.
