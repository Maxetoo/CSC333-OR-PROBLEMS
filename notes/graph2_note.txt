Minimizing Cost for a Manufacturer
Objective:
We are tasked with minimizing the cost of production for a manufacturer producing two products (X and Y) with constraints on labor and material.

Approach:

Cost Function:
The objective is to minimize the total production cost, where each unit of product X costs N2 to produce, and each unit of product Y costs N5. The objective function to minimize is:
Cost=2X+5Y
Constraints:
There are two primary constraints:

Labor: Product X requires 1 hour of labor, and product Y requires 2 hours. The total available labor is 6 hours. Hence, the constraint is:
X+2Y≤6
Material: Product X requires 2 units of material, and product Y requires 1 unit. The total available material is 5 units. Hence, the constraint is:
2X+Y≤5
We also have non-negativity constraints:

X≥0,Y≥0
Optimization:
To minimize the cost, we again use linprog, where the objective function is negated (for minimization) and the constraints are entered as inequalities.

Solving with linprog:
The optimal solution will give us the values of X and Y that minimize the total cost while satisfying the labor and material constraints.

Visualization:
As with the first problem, we can visualize the feasible region on a graph. The feasible area is bounded by the labor and material constraints, and the optimal point will be the one that minimizes the total cost.
