Maximizing Revenue from Two Products
Objective:
This problem involves maximizing revenue from two products, P1 and P2, subject to labor, raw material, and machine time constraints.

Approach:

Revenue Function:
The objective function is the revenue from the sale of products, 10P1 + 12P2. We aim to maximize this, so the function is negated for use with linprog.

Constraints:
The constraints represent the limits on labor, raw materials, and machine time. Each product consumes a certain amount of these resources, and we have upper limits on the total available amounts.

Linear Programming:
The optimization is performed using linprog, which minimizes the negative revenue function. The solution gives the optimal number of products P1 and P2 to produce to maximize revenue.

Graphical Analysis:
The feasible region is plotted to visually represent the space where all constraints are satisfied. The optimal point is highlighted, indicating the best production strategy.
