Meal Planning for a School Cafeteria
Objective:
Maximize the revenue from selling meals A and B in the cafeteria, subject to constraints on meat, vegetables, and rice availability.

Approach:

Revenue Function:
The revenue from meal A is N6, and from meal B is N5. The objective is to maximize the revenue, so the function is written as 6A + 5B. We negate the coefficients for maximization.

Resource Constraints:
The constraints are based on the availability of meat, vegetables, and rice. Each type of meal requires a specific amount of each resource. These constraints ensure that the cafeteria does not exceed the available resources.

Linear Programming:
The optimization is performed using linprog, which gives us the optimal number of meals A and B to prepare and serve to maximize revenue.

Graphical Representation:
The feasible region is plotted to show where all resource constraints are satisfied. The optimal solution is marked, indicating how many units of each meal should be prepared.
